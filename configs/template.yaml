# Template YAML for generate.py
#
# This file documents every supported parameter. You can:
# - Use a SINGLE-JOB form: put parameters at the top-level (name, bounds, elevation_source, terrain, buildings, output)
# - Use a MULTI-JOB form: put an array under `jobs:` and repeat those parameters per job
#
# CLI examples:
#   python generate.py --config configs/template.yaml           # run all jobs (if any)
#   python generate.py --config configs/template.yaml --job dc  # run a single job by name or output_prefix
#   python generate.py --config configs/template.yaml --outdir outputs/all  # override output directory

# SINGLE-JOB (annotated)
# ===========================
# Uncomment and fill to use the single-job form. Otherwise, use `jobs:` below.
#
# version: 1                # REQUIRED. Config schema version. Use 1.
# name: dc                  # OPTIONAL but recommended. Human-readable identifier. Also selectable via --job.
# output_prefix: dc         # REQUIRED for predictable outputs. Prefix for filenames (e.g., dc_land.obj).
#
# bounds:                   # REQUIRED. Geographic bounding box in [min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat] (degrees).
#   - -77.0728342158        #   min_lon (west). Negative for western hemisphere. Example: -77.07
#   - 38.8349886875         #   min_lat (south). Positive for northern hemisphere. Example: 38.83
#   - -76.9620071625        #   max_lon (east). Example: -76.96
#   - 38.9178722916         #   max_lat (north). Example: 38.91
#   # Tips:
#   # - Keep areas modest on first runs to reduce memory/time. A few km² is reasonable.
#   # - Use tools like map apps or GIS to read coordinates. Be mindful of lon/lat order.
#
# elevation_source:               # REQUIRED. Elevation data source settings.
#   type: geotiff                 # REQUIRED. One of: "srtm" | "geotiff".
#                                 #   srtm: reads SRTM tiles (*.hgt or .hgt.zip) located in topo_dir.
#                                 #   geotiff: reads a GeoTIFF file clipped to bounds.
#   topo_dir: topo                # REQUIRED. Directory with elevation assets (relative or absolute path).
#   file: USGS_1M_10_x....tif     # REQUIRED if type=geotiff. Filename under topo_dir. No path separators.
#                                 #   The GeoTIFF will be reprojected to EPSG:4326 if needed.
#                                 #   If bounds exceed GeoTIFF extents, they will be clamped.
#                                 #
#                                 # SRTM TILE NOTES (type=srtm):
#                                 # - Place tiles like N37W122.hgt.zip, N38W122.hgt.zip in topo_dir.
#                                 # - The system stitches tiles and crops them to your bounds.
#
# terrain:                        # OPTIONAL. Controls terrain meshing; defaults shown where applicable.
#   base_height: 250              # [meters] Z-offset of the base/platform under the terrain. Impacts wall height.
#   elevation_multiplier: 3.5     # Vertical exaggeration factor. 1.0 = real-world vertical scale; >1 exaggerates relief.
#   downsample_factor: 1          # Integer >=1. 1 keeps full resolution; higher values reduce resolution for speed/memory.
#   water_threshold: 0            # [meters] Elevation below which is considered water. Used for flattening & splitting.
#                                 #   null means: don't flatten or split by water level.
#   force_refresh: false          # If true, ignore terrain cache and recompute terrain even if cached.
#   decimate: false               # If true, attempt to reduce mesh face count via decimation (if supported by meshlib).
#   decimate_max_error: null      # [meters] Max allowed geometric error during decimation. Example: 1.0 or 2.0.
#   decimate_target_face_count: null  # Integer target faces. Example: 150000. Used alone or with max_error.
#   decimate_preserve_boundary: true  # Preserve outer boundaries when decimating.
#   split_at_water_level: true    # If true and water_threshold set, split terrain into land (above) and base (below).
#   merge_land_and_base: false    # If true, produce a single merged mesh in-memory (see output.save_merged to write it).
#   use_cache: true               # If true, cache terrain results in terrain_cache/ for faster repeat runs.
#   cache_max_age_days: 30        # Max cache age before a miss.
#
# buildings:                      # OPTIONAL. Enable to extract OSM buildings and generate a buildings mesh.
#   enabled: true                 # Master switch. When false, no building extraction or mesh is produced.
#   timeout: 120                  # [seconds] Overpass API timeout per request.
#   use_cache: true               # Cache extracted buildings under building_cache/.
#   cache_max_age_days: 30        # Building cache recency requirement.
#   extract:
#     force_refresh: false        # If true, ignore building cache and fetch fresh data.
#     max_building_distance_meters: 30  # Cluster radius for merging adjacent buildings. 0 disables clustering.
#   generate:
#     building_height_multiplier: 1.0   # Scales OSM/derived heights. 2.0 doubles heights.
#     min_building_height: 10.0         # [meters] Lower bound to avoid ultra-thin buildings.
#
# output:
#   directory: outputs/dc         # Directory to write .obj files (land, base, buildings, merged if enabled).
#   save_merged: false            # If true and terrain.merge_land_and_base is true, also write the merged mesh.
#   merged_filename: dc_merged.obj  # Optional custom name for merged mesh file.
